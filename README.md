# Banking Web Dashboard

This is a styled web dashboard for a net banking application. The page serves as a visual layout, simulating a banking portal with sections such as account details, transactions, transfers, and more. However, it does not contain any backend functionality or data processing.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Displays account balance and recent transactions.
- **Current Account**: A section for viewing account details, making transfers, viewing transactions, and downloading statements.
- **Savings Account**: Similar to the Current Account section, but for savings-related functionalities.
- **Transfer Money**: A form to simulate money transfers between accounts.
- **Transactions**: A section to list recent transactions (dummy data).
- **Statements**: Links to simulate downloading past bank statements.
- **FAQ**: A section with commonly asked questions related to banking.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the following files are present:
   - `index.html` (Main page with the layout)
   - `styles.css` (Contains all the page styling)
   - `script.js` (Handles interactivity, but no actual functionality)

3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the banking dashboard.

## Usage

This page provides a static, styled user interface for a banking dashboard. It includes:

- **Account Information**: Visual display of account balance, recent transactions, and available cards.
- **Transfer Money**: A form to simulate money transfers.
- **Statements and Transactions**: Links and lists for statement downloads and transaction history.
- **FAQ Section**: Display of common questions and answers, with a search bar.

## Note
